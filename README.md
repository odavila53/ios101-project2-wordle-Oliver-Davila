# Project 2 - iOS 101 Project 2 (Wordle Pt. 2)

Submitted by: Oliver Davila

iOS 101 Project 2 is an continuation of the previous wordle project except this time, we're supposed to integrate the settings screens and modify how the user can play the game. The purpose of this project is to familarize ourselves with optionals ,be able to access dictionaries, unwrap optionals, and use type casting properly.

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [X] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [X] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [X] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Some other improvements that can be added to this project is a little hint button. The hint should be give vague information that could possibily help the user guess the correct word

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Throughout this project, I had to familiarize myself with optionals and type casting. I was confused in the beginning when it said we can use a constant in the dictionary for us to use as a place value. It took me a while to realize we were able to include that. Everything went smoothly until the third exercise where you really needed to understand type casting to get it right. I ended up doing two if-let statements which ended up working.
